class AsyncObjectPool(BaseObjectPool):
    """
    Asynchronous object-pool, imitating Go's (Golang) sync.Pool implementation.
    This solution is used for object synchronization across multiple coroutines (not a thread-safe),
    with the main goal of minimizing memory related overhead by reusing already allocated memory.

    Attributes:
        cap (int | None): The maximum capacity of objects in the pool. If None, the pool has unlimited capacity.
        obj (Any): The class of objects to be managed by the pool. Defaults to GenericObject.
        on_put (Callable | None): Optional callback function to be executed when an object is put into the pool.
        on_get (Callable | None): Optional callback function to be executed when an object is retrieved from the pool.
        Callbacks should return `None` and only perform operations on the object itself;
        Any further processing on the object shall occur after getting it from the pool or before putting it back.
